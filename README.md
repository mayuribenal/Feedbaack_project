# Feedbaack_project
Project objective:

Create a Spring Boot project that will capture user feedback using a REST endpoint. The REST resource will take in parameters using HTTP POST. The feedback data will be then added to a database table.

Following requirements should be met:

● Create a MySQL table named feedback for storing feedback data
● An entity class Feedback should be made with annotations to link it with the feedback table
● A repository class should then map the entity class to the CrudRepository interface
● Create a REST controller class to create the REST endpoint. It should take in parameters using the POST protocol
● Data received in the REST controller will be then saved into the database
● Create a test form in HTML to submit data to the REST endpoint to ensure it’s working
● The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented
